#### Gameplay:
---
Fly around the map and kill all the ememies in each wave to reach the Boss Wave. You have some wiggle room, with a fully powered shield and 100% health to start the game. Don't take too many hits though! If you do you'll pay the price. Once you get to the Boss round, all luck to you. I won't spoil the secret! Ah, and lastly if you need a pick me up on health or shields just pick up the green and white pill! Lowest time is the highest score(obviously).
